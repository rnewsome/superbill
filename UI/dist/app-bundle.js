     * Creates a `lodash` object which wraps `value` to enable implicit method
     * chain sequences. Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections,
     * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value
     * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence
     * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped
     * with `_#value`.
     *
     * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be
     * enabled using `_.chain`.
     *
     * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until
     * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.
     *
     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.
     * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids
     * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of
     * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut
     * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only
     * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut
     * fusion is subject to change.
     *
     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is
     * directly or indirectly included in the build.
     *
     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.
     *
     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:
     * `concat`, `join`, `pop`, `push`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`
     *
     * The wrapper `String` methods are:
     * `replace` and `split`
     *
     * The wrapper methods that support shortcut fusion are:
     * `at`, `compact`, `drop`, `dropRight`, `dropWhile`, `filter`, `find`,
     * `findLast`, `head`, `initial`, `last`, `map`, `reject`, `reverse`, `slice`,
     * `tail`, `take`, `takeRight`, `takeRightWhile`, `takeWhile`, and `toArray`
     *
     * The chainable wrapper methods are:
     * `after`, `ary`, `assign`, `assignIn`, `assignInWith`, `assignWith`, `at`,
     * `before`, `bind`, `bindAll`, `bindKey`, `castArray`, `chain`, `chunk`,

 * Create an `onBeforeInput` event to match

 *
 * This event plugin is based on the native `textInput` event
 * available in Chrome, Safari, Opera, and IE. This event fires after
 * `onKeyPress` and `onCompositionEnd`, but before `onInput`.
 *
 * `beforeInput` is spec'd but not implemented in any browsers, and
 * the `input` event does not provide any useful information about what has
 * actually been added, contrary to the spec. Thus, `textInput` is the best
 * available event to identify the characters that have actually been inserted
 * into the target node.
 *
 * This plugin is also responsible for emitting `composition` events, thus
 * allowing us to share composition fallback code for both `beforeInput` and
 * `composition` event types.

/**
 * Summary of `ReactBrowserEventEmitter` event handling:
 *
 *  - Top-level delegation is used to trap most native browser events. This
 *    may only occur in the main thread and is the responsibility of
 *    ReactEventListener, which is injected and can therefore support pluggable
 *    event sources. This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.
 *
 *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This
 *    may be done in the worker thread.
 *
 *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to
 *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want
 *    to extract any synthetic events.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with
 *    "dispatches", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.

   * We listen for bubbled touch events on the document object.

   * Firefox v8.01 (and possibly others) exhibited strange behavior when

   * contained within that mount point (for example on the background) the
   * top-level listeners for `onmousemove` won't be called. However, if you

   * top-level listeners to the document object only, at least for these
   * movement types of events and possibly all events.
   *
   * @see http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/09/click_event_del.html

 * Use cases:
 * - Preserving the input selection ranges before/after reconciliation.
 *   Restoring selection even in the event of an unexpected error.
 * - Deactivating events while rearranging the DOM, preventing blurs/focuses,
 *   while guaranteeing that afterwards, the event system is reactivated.
 * - Flushing a queue of collected DOM mutations to the main UI thread after a
 *   reconciliation takes place in a worker thread.
 * - Invoking any collected `componentDidUpdate` callbacks after rendering new
 *   content.
 * - (Future use case): Wrapping particular flushes of the `ReactWorker` queue
 *   to preserve the `scrollTop` (an automatic scroll aware DOM).
 * - (Future use case): Layout calculations before and after DOM updates.
 *
 * Transactional plugin API:
 * - A module that has an `initialize` method that returns any precomputation.
 * - and a `close` method that accepts the precomputation. `close` is invoked
 *   when the wrapped process is completed, or has failed.
 *
 * @param {Array<TransactionalWrapper>} transactionWrapper Wrapper modules
